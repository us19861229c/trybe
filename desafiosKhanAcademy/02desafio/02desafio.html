        <h1>Challenge: You can learn text tags</h1>
        <p>
        Nobody’s born smart. <strong>all start at 0</strong> . Can’t talk, can’t walk, certainly can’t do algebra.<br>
        Adding, reading, writing, riding a bike.<strong>Nobody’s good at <em>anything</em> at first</strong> .<br>
        There was a time when <em>Einstein</em> couldn’t count to 10.<br>
        And <em>Shakespeare</em> had to learn his ABCs just like the rest of us.<br>
        Thankfully, we are born to learn.<br>
        Slowly. Surely. You stumble, slip, crawl, <strong>fall and fail and fall</strong>.<br>
        Frustrating. Confusing. Trying. Struggling.<br>
        <em>Until one day</em>, you walk.<br>
        <strong>One foot in front of the other</strong>. One idea on top of the next.<br>
        Each wrong answer making your brain a little bit stronger.<br>
        Failing is just another word for growing. And you keep going.<br>
        <strong>This. is. learning</strong>.<br>
        It’s not that you don’t get it. <br>
        You just don’t get it, yet.
        Because the most beautiful, complex concepts in the whole universe<br>
        are built on basic ideas that anyone, anywhere can understand.<br>
        Whoever you are, wherever you are.<br>
        </p>
        <p>
        You only have to know one thing:<br>
        <strong>You can learn anything.</strong>
